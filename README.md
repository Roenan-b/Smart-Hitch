# Smart Hitch ðŸš—ðŸšš

## Overview
**Smart Hitch** is a cutting-edge software solution designed for aftermarket air suspension systems in vehicles. This product integrates with a device installed in the hitch of a car, enabling automatic, real-time adjustments to airbags. The goal is to maintain the car as level as possible, reducing sag or excess height and keeping the connection between the vehicle and trailer hitch as flat as possible. This functionality directly contributes to reducing sway while towing, thereby improving overall towing safety for users.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Adjustments:** Automatically adjusts air suspension in real-time to maintain vehicle level.
- **Enhanced Towing Stability:** Keeps the hitch and trailer connection as flat as possible, reducing sway and improving safety.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to work with Air Lift air suspension systems for easy installation and operation.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** C/C++, Arduino
- **Communication Protocol:** CAN (Controller Area Network) for interaction with the air suspension springs

## Usage

- **Automatic Adjustments:** The system continuously monitors and adjusts the air suspension to keep the vehicle level while towing.
- **Manual Controls:** Access settings and adjustments via the user interface if manual intervention is needed.
- **Monitoring:** The device provides real-time feedback on suspension status and adjustments.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile App Integration:** Have this integrated into the existing Air Lift app
- **Data Logging:** Implement features to log and analyze towing performance over time.
- **Fleet Monitoring:** Expand the system to monitor fleets of vehicles, providing insights into vehicle performance and safety across multiple units.
- **Driving Safety Monitoring:** Introduce features to assess and monitor driving safety, including alerts for unsafe driving behaviors and system performance metrics.
